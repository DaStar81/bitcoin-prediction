***Don't actually use these models unless you want to lose all of your money!***

Each folder contains a different model/approach.

The BTC-data-scrape.py file gets daily historical prices of bitcoin over the last ~5 years from coinmarketcap.com and saves them to a numpy array with their respective unix timestamps. You can change the url in the script to scrape a different coin/token. The .npy file is my latest data scrape np array.
