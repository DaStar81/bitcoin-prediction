# Reinforcement-Learning-Trader
A Reinforcement Learning based cryptocurrency trading bot. *Don't actually use unless you want to lose all your money.*

This is a rehash of code used to solve the *Gambler's Problem* in Sutton & Barto's Reinforcement Learning textbook. The code uses RL Glue implementation from Sutton's CMPUT609 course.

After completing the gambler's problem, I thought I would try my hand at the stock market ;) 

This bot fails to make money (as expected) because RL is the wrong tool for the job!
