# AI-Bitcoin-Trader
Here lies my collection of get-rich-quick schemes to build a cryptocurrency trading bot. 

*Don't actually use unless you want to lose all your money!*

Each folder contains a different attempt.

The RL-trader is a rehash of code used to solve the *Gambler's Problem* in Sutton & Barto's Reinforcement Learning textbook. The code uses RL Glue implementation from Sutton's CMPUT609 course. This bot fails to make money (as expected) because RL is the wrong tool for the job!

The next attempt is using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict bitcoin prices. Code based on a [tutorial](http://www.jakob-aungiers.com/articles/a/Multidimensional-LSTM-Networks-to-Predict-Bitcoin-Price).
